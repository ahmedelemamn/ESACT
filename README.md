ESACT
=====

Edge Switch Automated Configuration template ( ESACT ), I've created this very simple python program for my work network , it is able to generate config templates for our edge switches within a minute , just a few parameters and you're good to go ,of course this works only in my work environment ( HP A5120 , A3100 , A3600 ) but i intend to develop it more to be more generalized over various vendor types with a broad support for all network designs
